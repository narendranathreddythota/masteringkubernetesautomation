***Book Description***
<p>Mastering Kubernetes Automation is the desired topic for all DevOps Engineers around the world. Kubernetes is an open-source matured container orchestrator platform designed by Google and now it is maintained by Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes is meant for Automation. This book is for readers who are looking for Kubernetes automation offerings which include techniques, examples, and comprehensive guides. After reading this book, the end-user should be able to build end-to-end automation projects with growing complexity and functionalities. This book will be a one-stop solution for all Software Engineers including DevOps, who would like to automate the Kubernetes manifest deployments and understand Kubernetes concepts in-depth in an easy manner. Topics include a detailed description and explanation of the Kubernetes Resources, Kubernetes concepts, Kubernetes endpoints, policies, CIS benchmark recommendations, Installation Guide of prerequisites, and some useful resources. Some practical examples that give away knowledge on how to deploy applications to the Kubernetes cluster for beginners. Introduction to the Helm and detailed explanation of packaging one microservice architecture-oriented application using Helm and automate the deployments using Helm. Introduction to the Kubernetes operators and detailed explanation of writing a Custom Controller, Custom Resource, and Custom Resource Definition with one microservice architecture-oriented application. Introduction to the Kubernetes JavaScript and Golang client libraries, and detailed explanation of automating the deployments of a microservice architecture-oriented application using JavaScript and Golang client libraries.</p>
